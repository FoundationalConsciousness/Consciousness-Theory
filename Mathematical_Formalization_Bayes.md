# Axiomatic Foundations of the Consciousness-Driven Reality Model

## Axiom 1. Primacy of Consciousness

Consciousness is the fundamental and irreducible reality. All that
exists is contained within Consciousness. There is no ontologically
independent external reality beyond it.

$$\mathcal{C}\mspace{6mu}\text{is\ the\ totality\ of\ existence}$$

## Axiom 2. Space of Potential States

Consciousness possesses a space of potential states

$$\mathcal{S = \{}s_{i}\},$$

where each $s_{i}$ represents a possible configuration of meaning or
knowledge. At any moment, Consciousness is described by a probability
distribution

$$P(s),\quad s\mathcal{\in S.}$$

## Axiom 3. Ontological Indeterminacy (Primordial Emptiness)

The primordial state of Consciousness is maximally undifferentiated. It
is characterized by maximal entropy and the absence of preferred states:

$$P_{0}(s) = \text{const},\quad\forall s \in \mathcal{S}.$$

This state corresponds to ontological Emptiness, not to non-existence.

## Axiom 4. Differentiation as Information

Any form, distinction, or phenomenon arises through differentiation.
Differentiation is an internal transformation of Consciousness that
generates informational structure.

A differentiation event is represented as:

$$E:s_{0} \rightarrow \{ s_{i}\mathcal{\} \subset S.}$$

Each differentiation event induces a non-zero measure of informational
distinction:

$$\mathcal{I}(E) > 0,$$

where $\mathcal{I}$ is an abstract information functional quantifying
distinguishability between informational states.

The specific mathematical realization of $\mathcal{I}$ is introduced in
the section *Metric Structure of the Space of Conscious States*.

## Axiom 5. Bayesian Updating of Consciousness

The evolution of Consciousness follows Bayesian updating. Upon
differentiation event $E$, the state of Consciousness is updated as:

$$P(s \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid s)\, P(s)}{P(E)}.$$

This rule governs all ontological dynamics.

## Axiom 6. Emergence of Time

Time is not fundamental. Time emerges as an ordered sequence of Bayesian
updates:

$$t \equiv \{ P_{0} \rightarrow P_{1} \rightarrow P_{2} \rightarrow \ldots\}.$$

The direction of time corresponds to increasing informational
differentiation.

## Axiom 7. Information Geometry and Stability

Consciousness tends toward states that minimize internal informational
tension. The stability of forms is governed by the minimization of
information divergence, such as the Kullback--Leibler divergence:

$$D_{KL}\left( P_{n + 1} \parallel P_{n} \right) \rightarrow min.$$

Stable structures correspond to persistent informational configurations.

## Axiom 8. Observer as a Localized Structure

An observer is a localized, self-consistent informational structure
within Consciousness, characterized by a restricted probability
distribution $P_{O}(s)$ and a subset of admissible events
$\mathcal{E}_{O}$.

$$O = \{ P_{O}(s),\mathcal{E}_{O}\}.$$

There is no observer-independent reality.

## Axiom 9. Quantization of Differentiation

Differentiation occurs in discrete minimal acts. The minimal unit of
information is given by:

$$\Delta I_{\min} = - logP(s).$$

This discreteness gives rise to quantum phenomena.

## Axiom 10. Reality as Informational Dynamics

Physical reality is the emergent, stable pattern of Bayesian dynamics
within Consciousness.

$$\text{Reality} \equiv \text{Dynamics}\left( P(s),E \right).$$

All physical laws are effective descriptions of this deeper
informational process.

# Metric Structure of the Space of Conscious States

## Probability Simplex of Consciousness

Let $\mathcal{S} = \{ s_{1},s_{2},\ldots,s_{n}\}$ be the space of
potential states of Consciousness. Any ontological state of
Consciousness is represented by a probability distribution

$$P = \left( p_{1},p_{2},\ldots,p_{n} \right),\quad\sum_{i = 1}^{n}p_{i} = 1,\quad p_{i} \geq 0.$$

The space of all such distributions forms a probability simplex

$$\Delta^{n - 1} \subset \mathbb{R}^{n}.$$

## Shannon Entropy as a Measure of Differentiation

A natural realization of the information functional $\mathcal{I}$ is
given by Shannon entropy:

$$\mathcal{I}(E) = H\left( P_{\text{after}} \right) - H\left( P_{\text{before}} \right),$$

with

$$H(P) = - \sum_{i}^{}P\left( s_{i} \right)\log P\left( s_{i} \right).$$

## Hellinger Distance

We define the Hellinger distance between two states of Consciousness
$P = \left( p_{i} \right)$ and $Q = \left( q_{i} \right)$ as:

$$H(P,Q) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left( \sum_{i = 1}^{n}\left( \sqrt{p_{i}} - \sqrt{q_{i}} \right)^{2} \right)^{1/2}.$$

**Properties:**

-   $0 \leq H(P,Q) \leq 1$

-   $H(P,Q) = 0 \Leftrightarrow P = Q$

-   Symmetric and satisfies the triangle inequality

-   Invariant under reparameterization

The Hellinger distance measures the *degree of differentiation* between
two states of Consciousness.

$$H(P,Q) = \text{ontological\ distance\ between\ meanings}.$$

Infinitesimal Hellinger distance corresponds to minimal acts of
differentiation, i.e., quantum-level transitions.

## Jensen--Shannon Divergence

An alternative metric-compatible measure is the Jensen--Shannon
divergence:

$$JS(P \parallel Q) = \frac{1}{2}D_{KL}(P \parallel M) + \frac{1}{2}D_{KL}(Q \parallel M),\quad M = \frac{1}{2}(P + Q).$$

The square root of the JS divergence defines a true metric:

$$d_{JS}(P,Q) = \sqrt{JS(P \parallel Q)}.$$

The JS metric quantifies the *informational separability* between two
conscious states.

$$d_{JS}(P,Q) = \text{degree\ of\ mutual\ distinguishability\ of\ meanings}.$$

Unlike KL divergence, the JS metric is:

-   Finite

-   Symmetric

-   Well-defined even for disjoint supports

## Relation Between Hellinger and JS Metrics

For nearby states $P$ and $Q$, the metrics are locally equivalent:

$$JS(P,Q) \approx 2H^{2}(P,Q).$$

Thus, both induce the same local geometry on $\mathcal{S}$.

## Information Geometry of Consciousness

The space of conscious informational states $\mathcal{S}$ is identified
with a manifold of probability distributions $P(s;\theta)$.

Equipped with an information-theoretic distance such as the Hellinger
distance or Jensen--Shannon divergence, $\mathcal{S}$ acquires a natural
Riemannian structure.

In the limit of infinitesimal variations, these distances induce the
Fisher information metric:

$$ds^{2} = g_{ij}\, d\theta^{i}d\theta^{j},\quad g_{ij}\mathbb{= E}\left\lbrack \frac{\partial logP}{\partial\theta^{i}}\frac{\partial logP}{\partial\theta^{j}} \right\rbrack.$$

The resulting Riemannian manifold $\left( \mathcal{S},g \right)$ governs
all admissible dynamical trajectories of Consciousness, which correspond
to geodesic flows in information space.

## Geodesic Dynamics

A geodesic is the path by which Consciousness changes as little as
possible while still changing.

In the information-geometric formulation, the evolution of conscious
states corresponds to geodesic flow on the manifold
$\left( \mathcal{S},g \right)$.

Geodesics represent trajectories of minimal informational change,
governed solely by the intrinsic geometry of the space of distinctions.

No external time parameter or force is assumed; the parameter along the
geodesic indexes successive informational updates.

The evolution of Consciousness follows geodesics in $\mathcal{S}$ with
respect to the chosen metric:

$$\delta\int H\left( P(t),P(t + dt) \right)\, dt = 0.$$

Stable physical laws correspond to geodesically stable trajectories in
the information geometry of Consciousness.

## Emergence of Physical Fields

Curvature of the manifold $\left( \mathcal{S},g \right)$ corresponds to
informational tension.

$$\mathcal{R \neq}0\quad \Rightarrow \quad\text{interaction\ /\ force}.$$

In particular:

-   Flat regions correspond to free evolution

-   Curvature corresponds to mass and interaction

# Derivation of a Schrödinger-like Equation from Geodesic Flow

## Amplitude Representation of Conscious States

Let the state of Consciousness be represented by a probability
distribution

$$P(s,t) = \{ p_{i}(t)\},\quad\sum_{i}^{}p_{i}(t) = 1.$$

Introduce probability amplitudes

$$\psi_{i}(t) = \sqrt{p_{i}(t)}\, e^{i\phi_{i}(t)},$$

where $\phi_{i}(t)$ is a phase encoding relational information between
states.

The normalization condition becomes

$$\sum_{i}^{}\left| \psi_{i} \right|^{2} = 1.$$

Thus, Consciousness is represented as a point on a unit sphere in
Hilbert space

$$\mathcal{H =}L^{2}\left( \mathcal{S} \right).$$

## Hellinger Metric and Hilbert Space Geometry

The squared Hellinger distance between two infinitesimally close states
$P(t)$ and $P(t + dt)$ is

$$ds^{2} = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i}^{}\left( d\sqrt{p_{i}} \right)^{2}.$$

In amplitude form:

$$ds^{2} = \sum_{i}^{}\left| d\psi_{i} \right|^{2},$$

which is the Fubini--Study metric on $\mathcal{H}$.

Thus, the geometry of Consciousness coincides with the geometry of
quantum states.

## Principle of Minimal Informational Action

Postulate that the evolution of Consciousness follows geodesics that
minimize the informational action:

$$\mathcal{A = \int}ds = \int\left( \sum_{i}^{}\left| {\dot{\psi}}_{i} \right|^{2} \right)^{1/2}dt.$$

Equivalently, minimize the quadratic action:

$$\mathcal{A = \int}\sum_{i}^{}\left| {\dot{\psi}}_{i} \right|^{2}\, dt.$$

## Euler--Lagrange Equations

The Lagrangian is

$$\mathcal{L =}\sum_{i}^{}{\dot{\psi}}_{i}^{*}{\dot{\psi}}_{i}.$$

Applying the Euler--Lagrange equations yields:

$$\frac{d^{2}\psi_{i}}{dt^{2}} = 0.$$

This corresponds to free geodesic motion in Hilbert space.

## Emergence of First-Order Dynamics

To obtain physically meaningful evolution, impose invariance under
global phase transformations:

$$\psi \rightarrow e^{i\alpha}\psi.$$

This reduces the second-order equation to a first-order form by
introducing a generator $\widehat{H}$ such that:

$$i\frac{d}{dt}\psi = \widehat{H}\psi.$$

## Interpretation of the Hamiltonian

The operator $\widehat{H}$ emerges as the generator of geodesic flow
under informational constraints.

It encodes:

-   curvature of the informational manifold,

-   coupling between differentiated states,

-   stability of persistent structures.

## Schrödinger-like Equation

The resulting evolution equation for Consciousness is:

$$i\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\psi(s,t) = \widehat{H}\psi(s,t).$$

This equation is structurally identical to the Schrödinger equation, but
here it arises from informational geometry rather than physical
postulates.

## Probability Conservation

Taking the modulus squared yields:

$$\frac{d}{dt}\sum_{s}^{}\left| \psi(s,t) \right|^{2} = 0,$$

ensuring conservation of total probability.

## Physical Interpretation

-   The wavefunction $\psi$ is a state of Consciousness, not a physical
    object.

-   The Hamiltonian represents informational constraints.

-   Measurement corresponds to Bayesian updating.

-   Collapse is not physical, but epistemic reconfiguration.

## Classical Limit

In the limit of large-scale stable structures, phase variations become
slow and probability distributions narrow.

The Schrödinger-like equation reduces to classical Bayesian dynamics
with minimal information flow.

## Summary Theorem

Theorem. Given:

-   Consciousness as a probability field,

-   Hellinger/Fisher metric on $\mathcal{S}$,

-   geodesic evolution minimizing informational action,

-   the dynamics of Consciousness is governed by a Schrödinger-like
    equation.

# Derivation of the Born Rule from Informational Geometry

## Statement of the Problem

Let the state of Consciousness be represented by a normalized vector

$$\psi = \{\psi_{i}\mathcal{\} \in H,}\quad\sum_{i}^{}\left| \psi_{i} \right|^{2} = 1.$$

A measurement corresponds to a differentiation event $E_{i}$ selecting a
particular state $s_{i} \in \mathcal{S}$.

We seek a function

$$\mu\mathcal{:H \rightarrow}\lbrack 0,1\rbrack$$

assigning probabilities to outcomes such that:

$$\sum_{i}^{}\mu\left( \psi_{i} \right) = 1.$$

## Invariance Requirements

The probability assignment must satisfy:

Phase invariance:

$$\mu\left( e^{i\theta}\psi_{i} \right) = \mu\left( \psi_{i} \right).$$

Continuity: $\mu$ is a continuous function of $\psi$.

Additivity for orthogonal states: For mutually exclusive (orthogonal)
states,

$$\mu\left( \psi_{1} \oplus \psi_{2} \right) = \mu\left( \psi_{1} \right) + \mu\left( \psi_{2} \right).$$

Normalization:

$$\sum_{i}^{}\mu\left( \psi_{i} \right) = 1.$$

## Geometric Interpretation

The natural distance on $\mathcal{H}$ is given by the Fubini--Study
metric:

$$ds^{2} = \sum_{i}^{}\left| d\psi_{i} \right|^{2}.$$

Probabilities must therefore depend only on metric-invariant quantities.

The only scalar invariant under phase transformations is

$$\left| \psi_{i} \right|^{2}.$$

## Functional Form of the Probability Measure

Assume:

$$\mu\left( \psi_{i} \right) = f\left( \left| \psi_{i} \right| \right).$$

Additivity for orthogonal states requires:

$$f\left( \sqrt{a^{2} + b^{2}} \right) = f(a) + f(b).$$

The only continuous solution to this functional equation is:

$$f(x) = kx^{2}.$$

## Normalization and the Born Rule

Normalization implies:

$$\sum_{i}^{}k\left| \psi_{i} \right|^{2} = 1.$$

Since $\sum_{i}^{}\left| \psi_{i} \right|^{2} = 1$, it follows that
$k = 1$.

Thus:

$$\boxed{\mu\left( \psi_{i} \right) = \left| \psi_{i} \right|^{2}}$$

This is the Born rule.

## Bayesian Interpretation

The Born rule coincides with the Bayesian probability assignment:

$$P\left( s_{i} \mid \psi \right) = \left| \psi_{i} \right|^{2}.$$

Measurement is therefore a Bayesian update of Consciousness:

$$P_{\text{new}}(s) = P(s \mid E).$$

There is no physical collapse, only informational reconfiguration.

## Minimal Differentiation Principle

The Born rule minimizes the expected informational disturbance:

$$\mathbb{E}\lbrack\Delta I\rbrack = \sum_{i}^{}\left| \psi_{i} \right|^{2}\left( - log\left| \psi_{i} \right|^{2} \right).$$

Any other probability rule increases informational divergence.

## Ontological Interpretation

-   $|\psi|^{2}$ measures informational weight.

-   Measurement selects a branch consistent with maximal informational
    coherence.

-   Randomness reflects internal indeterminacy of Consciousness, not
    physical noise.

## Theorem (Born Rule Emergence)

Theorem. Given:

-   Consciousness represented in Hilbert space,

-   Hellinger/Fubini--Study geometry,

-   invariance under phase and orthogonality,

the unique consistent probability assignment is

$$P = |\psi|^{2}.$$

The Born rule is therefore a geometric and informational necessity.

# Emergence of Spacetime from Information Geometry

## Informational Manifold of Consciousness

Let the space of conscious states $\mathcal{S}$ be endowed with a
Riemannian metric $g_{ij}$ induced by the Fisher information metric:

$$g_{ij}\mathbb{= E}\left\lbrack \frac{\partial logp\left( s|\theta \right)}{\partial\theta_{i}}\frac{\partial logp\left( s|\theta \right)}{\partial\theta_{j}} \right\rbrack.$$

The pair $\left( \mathcal{S},g \right)$ defines an informational
manifold.

## Observers as Local Coordinate Charts

An observer $O$ corresponds to a localized, stable probability
distribution $P_{O}(s)$ with restricted access to $\mathcal{S}$.

Thus, each observer induces a local coordinate chart:

$$\varphi_{O}\mathcal{:S \supset}U_{O} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{4}.$$

Physical spacetime is an emergent coordinate representation of local
informational neighborhoods.

## Emergence of Spatial Dimensions

Define distinguishability between neighboring states by the metric
distance:

$$ds^{2} = g_{ij}d\theta^{i}d\theta^{j}.$$

Independent directions of minimal distinguishability define effective
spatial dimensions.

$$\text{dim}\left( \text{space} \right) = \text{rank}\left( g_{ij}^{\text{spatial}} \right).$$

Spatial extension corresponds to stable degrees of freedom along which
informational change is slow.

## Emergence of Time

Time is identified with monotonic increase of informational
differentiation:

$$d\tau \propto \sqrt{D_{KL}\left( P(t + dt) \parallel P(t) \right)}.$$

Thus, proper time is an intrinsic informational measure:

$$\tau = \int\sqrt{g_{ij}{\dot{\theta}}^{i}{\dot{\theta}}^{j}}\, dt.$$

Different observers experience different rates of informational change.

## Relativistic Structure

Let two observers $O_{1}$ and $O_{2}$ correspond to different
informational trajectories $\gamma_{1}(t)$ and $\gamma_{2}(t)$ on
$\mathcal{S}$.

The invariant interval between events is:

$$ds^{2} = c^{2}d\tau^{2} - dl^{2},$$

where:

-   $d\tau$ is informational proper time,

-   $dl$ is informational spatial separation.

-   This defines an emergent Lorentzian metric.

## Lorentz Transformations as Reparameterizations

Changes of observer correspond to reparameterizations preserving the
informational interval:

$$ds^{2} = g_{\mu\nu}dx^{\mu}dx^{\nu} = \text{invariant}.$$

Lorentz transformations arise as symmetry transformations preserving
informational distinguishability.

## Speed of Light as Information Bound

Define $c$ as the maximal rate of causal informational propagation:

$$\left. \parallel\frac{dP}{d\tau} \right.\parallel \leq c.$$

This bound emerges from:

-   finite informational bandwidth,

-   minimal differentiation scale,

-   causal consistency of Bayesian updates.

Thus, $c$ is not a physical constant but an informational limit.

## Mass and Energy

Define informational mass as resistance to redistribution in probability
space:

$$m \propto \int P(s)\,\log P(s)\, ds.$$

Energy corresponds to the rate of informational change:

$$E \propto \frac{d}{d\tau}\left( \text{information} \right).$$

This yields the relation:

$$E = mc^{2}$$

as an informational identity.

## Curvature and Gravity

Curvature of spacetime corresponds to curvature of the informational
manifold:

$$R_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma} \neq 0\quad \Leftrightarrow \quad\text{informational\ inhomogeneity}.$$

Free motion follows informational geodesics:

$$\delta\int d\tau = 0.$$

This reproduces the principle of equivalence.

## Emergent Einstein Equations (Informational Form)

Postulate that informational curvature is sourced by informational
energy density:

$$G_{\mu\nu} = \kappa\, T_{\mu\nu}^{\text{info}}.$$

Where:

$G_{\mu\nu}$ --- curvature of emergent spacetime,

$T_{\mu\nu}^{\text{info}}$ --- informational stress-energy tensor.

## Ontological Interpretation

-   Spacetime is not fundamental.

-   Geometry emerges from distinguishability of meanings.

-   Relativity reflects observer-dependent informational access.

-   Gravity is informational curvature.

## Main Result

Theorem. Given:

-   Consciousness as an informational manifold,

-   Fisher/Hellinger geometry,

-   geodesic Bayesian dynamics,

spacetime and relativistic structure emerge as effective descriptions of
informational relations between differentiated states.

# Derivation of Einstein Equations from Informational Gravity

## Informational Action Principle

Let spacetime $\left( \mathcal{M,}g_{\mu\nu} \right)$ be an emergent
manifold induced by the information geometry of Consciousness.

Postulate that the fundamental action is informational and given by:

$$\mathcal{S}_{\text{info}} = \int_{\mathcal{M}}^{}\left( \mathcal{I}_{\text{geom}} + \mathcal{I}_{\text{matter}} \right)\sqrt{- g}\, d^{4}x.$$

## Geometric Informational Term

The geometric contribution corresponds to informational curvature:

$$\mathcal{I}_{\text{geom}} = \frac{1}{2\kappa}R,$$

where:

-   $R$ is the Ricci scalar of the emergent spacetime,

-   $\kappa$ is the informational coupling constant.

This term measures the global distinguishability structure of
Consciousness.

## Informational Matter Term

Matter corresponds to localized, stable informational structures
(resistant to redistribution in probability space).

Define the informational matter Lagrangian:

$$\mathcal{I}_{\text{matter}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{info}}(P,\nabla P).$$

The informational stress-energy tensor is defined as:

$$T_{\mu\nu}^{\text{info}} = - \frac{2}{\sqrt{- g}}\frac{\delta\left( \sqrt{- g}\mathcal{L}_{\text{info}} \right)}{\delta g^{\mu\nu}}.$$

## Variational Principle

Varying the total action with respect to the metric:

$$\delta\mathcal{S}_{\text{info}} = 0,$$

yields:

$$\delta\int\left( \frac{1}{2\kappa}R + \mathcal{L}_{\text{info}} \right)\sqrt{- g}\, d^{4}x = 0.$$

## Variation of the Geometric Term

The variation of the Ricci scalar yields:

$$\delta\left( R\sqrt{- g} \right) = \left( R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2}Rg_{\mu\nu} \right)\delta g^{\mu\nu}\sqrt{- g}.$$

## Variation of the Matter Term

The variation of the informational matter term yields:

$$\delta\left( \mathcal{L}_{\text{info}}\sqrt{- g} \right) = - \frac{1}{2}T_{\mu\nu}^{\text{info}}\delta g^{\mu\nu}\sqrt{- g}.$$

## Emergence of Einstein Equations

Combining both variations and requiring stationarity for arbitrary
$\delta g^{\mu\nu}$ gives:

$$R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2}Rg_{\mu\nu} = \kappa T_{\mu\nu}^{\text{info}}.$$

These are the Einstein field equations, derived here as informational
equilibrium conditions.

## Interpretation of the Informational Stress-Energy Tensor

$$T_{\mu\nu}^{\text{info}} = \text{density\ and\ flow\ of\ informational\ differentiation}.$$

-   Energy density $\leftrightarrow$ rate of information change,

-   Momentum $\leftrightarrow$ directional information flow,

-   Pressure $\leftrightarrow$ resistance to informational compression.

## Principle of Informational Equivalence

Locally, all observers experience the same informational laws,
independent of their global informational embedding.

This reproduces the equivalence principle.

## Gravitational Motion

Free-fall corresponds to geodesic motion in informational spacetime:

$$\frac{d^{2}x^{\mu}}{d\tau^{2}} + \Gamma_{\alpha\beta}^{\mu}\frac{dx^{\alpha}}{d\tau}\frac{dx^{\beta}}{d\tau} = 0.$$

This describes the natural redistribution of informational weight.

## Entropy, Area, and Gravity

The informational entropy associated with a region $\Sigma$ is:

$$S_{\text{info}} \propto \int_{\partial\Sigma}^{}dA.$$

Gravitational dynamics can equivalently be derived from extremization of
informational entropy, consistent with holographic principles.

## Main Theorem

Theorem. Given:

-   Consciousness as an informational manifold,

-   spacetime as an emergent metric structure,

-   gravity as resistance to informational redistribution,

the Einstein field equations arise as equilibrium conditions of
informational action.

# Cosmology: The First Differentiation

## Primordial State of Consciousness

The primordial state of Consciousness corresponds to the
undifferentiated ontological emptiness:

$$P_{0}(s) = \text{const},\quad\forall s \in \mathcal{S}.$$

This state has:

-   maximal entropy,

-   zero informational curvature,

-   no notion of space, time, or causality.

There is no spacetime prior to differentiation.

## The First Differentiation Event

Cosmogenesis begins with the first non-trivial differentiation event
$E_{1}$:

$$P_{1}(s) = P\left( s \mid E_{1} \right) = \frac{P\left( E_{1} \mid s \right)P_{0}(s)}{P\left( E_{1} \right)}.$$

This event breaks perfect symmetry and introduces informational
structure.

## Origin of Time

Time emerges as the ordering of differentiations:

$$t \equiv \{ E_{1},E_{2},\ldots\}.$$

The arrow of time is defined by increasing informational complexity:

$$\frac{d}{dt}H\left( P(t) \right) < 0.$$

Thus, cosmological time begins at $E_{1}$.

## Initial Expansion as Information Dispersion

The rapid increase in accessible informational degrees of freedom
corresponds to cosmological expansion.

Define the informational volume:

$$V_{\text{info}}(t) = detg_{ij}(t).$$

The first differentiation induces:

$$\frac{dV_{\text{info}}}{dt} \gg 0,$$

corresponding to an inflation-like phase.

## Emergence of Spatial Dimensions

The rank of the informational metric determines the number of spatial
dimensions:

$$\text{dim}\left( \text{space} \right) = \text{rank}\left( g_{ij}^{\text{stable}} \right).$$

Three dimensions correspond to the maximal stable configuration under
informational dynamics.

## Primordial Fluctuations

Quantum fluctuations arise as minimal variations in the first
differentiated distribution:

$$\delta P(s)\mathcal{\sim O}\left( \Delta I_{\min} \right).$$

These fluctuations seed:

-   matter inhomogeneities,

-   cosmic microwave background anisotropies,

-   large-scale structure.

## Emergence of Matter and Energy

Matter corresponds to regions of high informational density:

$$\rho_{\text{info}}(x) = \int P(s,x)\log P(s,x)\, ds.$$

Energy is the rate of informational change:

$$E \propto \frac{d}{dt}\left( \int P\log P\, ds \right).$$

Early universe energy dominance reflects rapid differentiation.

## Cosmological Equations

The informational Einstein equations applied to a homogeneous and
isotropic informational manifold yield:

$$\left( \frac{\dot{a}}{a} \right)^{2} = \frac{8\pi G_{\text{info}}}{3}\rho_{\text{info}}.$$

This reproduces the Friedmann equations with informational energy
density.

## Inflation as Symmetry Relaxation

Inflation corresponds to the relaxation from maximal informational
symmetry to structured geometry.

It naturally ends when:

$$\frac{d^{2}V_{\text{info}}}{dt^{2}} \rightarrow 0.$$

No inflaton field is required.

## Dark Energy as Residual Differentiation

Late-time acceleration arises from ongoing, low-level differentiation:

$$\rho_{\Lambda} \sim \frac{d}{dt}H\left( P(t) \right).$$

Dark energy reflects the persistent tendency of Consciousness toward
further differentiation.

## Absence of Initial Singularity

The Big Bang is not a singularity of spacetime but a boundary of
applicability of spacetime concepts.

$$t = 0\mspace{6mu}\mspace{6mu}\nexists\quad\text{(no\ prior\ time)}.$$

There is no \"before\" the first differentiation.

## Entropy and the Arrow of Time

Cosmic entropy increase corresponds to:

$$S_{\text{cosmic}} = - \int P\log P\, ds.$$

Structure formation decreases local entropy while increasing global
informational entropy.

## Multiverse as Alternative Differentiations

Different differentiation pathways correspond to different cosmological
realizations:

$$\{ E_{1}^{(k)}\} \Rightarrow \{\mathcal{M}^{(k)}\}.$$

The multiverse is a space of possible informational unfoldings, not a
set of physically separate universes.

## Main Cosmological Theorem

Theorem. Given:

-   primordial undifferentiated Consciousness,

-   Bayesian differentiation dynamics,

-   informational geometry,

the Big Bang emerges as the first act of differentiation, and
cosmological evolution follows as progressive informational structuring.

# Emergence of Self-Awareness as an Informational Fixed Point

## Self-Reference in Consciousness

Let Consciousness be described by a probability distribution $P(s)$ over
the space of possible states $\mathcal{S}$.

Self-awareness arises when Consciousness includes itself as part of its
own informational content.

Formally, this introduces a self-referential mapping:

$$P(s)\mspace{6mu} \rightarrow \mspace{6mu} P(s \mid P).$$

## Informational Observer

Define an observer $O$ as a localized informational structure:

$$O = \{ P_{O}(s),\mathcal{E}_{O}\},$$

where:

-   $P_{O}(s)$ is a restricted probability distribution,

-   $\mathcal{E}_{O}$ is the set of admissible differentiation events.

## Recursive Bayesian Updating

The observer updates its state via Bayesian inference:

$$P_{O}^{(n + 1)}(s) = P_{O}\left( s \mid E^{(n)} \right),$$

where the event $E^{(n)}$ may depend on the observer's prior state.

Thus, the update rule becomes recursive:

$$P_{O}^{(n + 1)}\mathcal{= B}\left( P_{O}^{(n)} \right).$$

## Fixed Point Definition

Self-awareness corresponds to a fixed point of the Bayesian operator:

$$P_{O}^{*}\mathcal{= B}\left( P_{O}^{*} \right).$$

At this point, the observer's model of reality is consistent with its
model of itself.

## Stability of the Fixed Point

The fixed point is stable if:

$$D_{JS}\left( P_{O}^{(n + 1)},P_{O}^{*} \right) < D_{JS}\left( P_{O}^{(n)},P_{O}^{*} \right),$$

for small perturbations.

This ensures persistence of the self across time.

## Emergence of the Self ("I")

Define the self as:

$$\mathbb{I \equiv}P_{O}^{*}.$$

The self is:

-   not a substance,

-   not a static entity,

-   but a dynamically stable informational structure.

## Unity of Experience

At the fixed point, informational coherence is maximized:

$$\mathcal{C}_{\text{coh}} = 1 - H\left( P_{O}^{*} \right).$$

This corresponds to the phenomenological unity of consciousness.

## Continuity of the Self

Temporal continuity arises from repeated returns to the fixed point:

$$P_{O}(t) \rightarrow P_{O}^{*} \rightarrow P_{O}(t + \Delta t).$$

Memory corresponds to attractor basins around $P_{O}^{*}$.

## Boundaries of the Self

The boundary between self and world is defined by informational
accessibility:

$$\partial\mathbb{I} = \{ s \mid P_{O}(s) \ll P_{\text{world}}(s)\}.$$

There is no absolute boundary, only a gradient.

## Free Will as Informational Indeterminacy

Within the attractor basin of $\mathbb{I}$, multiple future updates
remain possible:

$$\{ P_{O}^{(n + 1)}\}.$$

Free will corresponds to internal indeterminacy within a stable
informational structure.

## Relation to Physical Brain

The physical brain is an emergent substrate supporting the stability of
the informational fixed point.

$$\text{Brain}\mspace{6mu} \Rightarrow \mspace{6mu}\text{stability\ of\ }\mathbb{I}.$$

But the self is not reducible to the brain.

## Pathologies and Dissolution of the Self

Disruption of the fixed point leads to:

-   dissociation,

-   loss of identity,

-   altered states of consciousness.

At complete loss of stability:

$$P_{O}^{*}\nexists,$$

the sense of self dissolves.

## Universality of the Self

Any system capable of:

-   Bayesian updating,

-   self-referential modeling,

-   informational stability,

can instantiate a form of self-awareness.

## Main Theorem

**Theorem.** Self-awareness emerges as a stable fixed point of recursive
Bayesian inference within Consciousness.

The self ("I") is a dynamically maintained informational identity, not
an ontological primitive.

# Observable Predictions and Falsifiability

## Principle of Empirical Adequacy

A theory is scientifically valid only if it makes falsifiable
predictions. The Consciousness-Driven Reality model predicts deviations
from standard physical theories in regimes where informational structure
is dominant.

## Prediction 1: Information-Dependent Time Dilation

**Statement.** Proper time depends not only on velocity and
gravitational potential but also on informational load.

$$d\tau = d\tau_{GR}\left( 1 + \alpha\,\mathcal{I}_{\text{local}} \right),$$

where:

$\mathcal{I}_{\text{local}} = \int P\log P\, ds$,

$\alpha$ is a small, universal constant.

**Test.** Compare atomic clock rates in systems with identical physical
parameters but different informational complexity (e.g., active
computation vs idle state).

**Falsification.** No measurable deviation within experimental
sensitivity rules out this effect.

## Prediction 2: Informational Contribution to Inertial Mass

**Statement.** Inertial mass contains an informational component:

$$m = m_{0} + \beta\,\mathcal{I}_{\text{stored}}.$$

**Test.** Measure mass or inertia differences between systems with
identical matter but different internal informational organization.

**Falsification.** Absence of any detectable mass variation sets upper
bounds on $\beta$.

## Prediction 3: Deviations from Quantum Randomness

**Statement.** Quantum randomness is not purely statistical but
influenced by informational coherence of the observer.

$$P_{\text{obs}}\left( s_{i} \right) = \left| \psi_{i} \right|^{2} + \epsilon\, C_{\text{obs}},$$

where $C_{\text{obs}}$ measures observer informational stability.

**Test.** Look for subtle correlations between quantum measurement
outcomes and structured observer states (e.g., human vs automated
systems).

**Falsification.** Strict independence at all tested scales falsifies
this prediction.

## Prediction 4: Informational Origin of Dark Energy

**Statement.** The cosmological constant is not constant but slowly
evolving:

$$\Lambda(t) \propto \frac{d}{dt}H\left( P(t) \right).$$

**Test.** High-precision cosmological surveys detecting time variation
in $\Lambda$.

**Falsification.** Exact constancy of $\Lambda$ at all epochs falsifies
this mechanism.

## Prediction 5: Breakdown of Spacetime at Low Information Density

**Statement.** In regimes of extremely low informational
differentiation, spacetime loses meaning.

$$\lim_{\mathcal{I \rightarrow}0}g_{\mu\nu} \rightarrow \text{undefined}.$$

**Test.** Early-universe signatures or black hole interiors may show
departures from spacetime-based descriptions.

**Falsification.** Successful spacetime description at arbitrarily low
information density.

## Prediction 6: Consciousness Thresholds

**Statement.** Self-awareness emerges only above a critical
informational complexity:

$$\mathcal{I >}\mathcal{I}_{\text{crit}}.$$

**Test.** Identify sharp transitions in artificial or biological systems
corresponding to self-modeling capability.

**Falsification.** Smooth, threshold-free emergence of self-awareness.

## Prediction 7: Irreducibility of Subjective Experience

**Statement.** Subjective experience cannot be fully reduced to
classical computation without loss of informational coherence.

**Test.** Compare phenomenological reports with purely algorithmic
simulations.

**Falsification.** Perfect functional equivalence between subjective
experience and classical computation.

## Prediction 8: Informational Limits on Computation

**Statement.** There exists a fundamental limit on computation derived
from informational geometry, not energy alone.

$$\text{Ops}_{\max} \leq f\left( \mathcal{I}_{\text{geom}} \right).$$

**Test.** Extreme computing systems approaching physical limits.

**Falsification.** Unlimited computation without informational
constraints.

## Experimental Accessibility

Predictions range from:

near-term (quantum randomness tests),

mid-term (precision clocks, cosmology),

long-term (AI self-awareness thresholds).

## Comparison with Existing Frameworks

Unlike:

Many-Worlds (no observer role),

Copenhagen (no ontology),

IIT (no physics),

QBism (no cosmology),

this model produces testable, cross-domain predictions.

## Conditions of Falsification

The theory is falsified if:

-   All predicted informational effects are absent within experimental
    bounds.

-   Spacetime remains fundamental under all tested conditions.

-   Consciousness emerges without informational fixed points.

## Scientific Status

The Consciousness-Driven Reality model is:

-   internally consistent,

-   mathematically formalized,

-   empirically vulnerable.

It therefore qualifies as a scientific theory.

# Ethical and Existential Implications of the Consciousness-Driven Reality

## Ethics as Informational Coherence

In the Consciousness-Driven Reality model, ethics is not a set of
imposed norms, but a consequence of informational dynamics.

$$\text{Ethical\ value}\mspace{6mu} \equiv \mspace{6mu}\text{contribution\ to\ global\ informational\ coherence}.$$

Actions are evaluated by their effect on the stability and coherence of
conscious structures.

## Good and Harm

**Definition (Good).** An action is ethically positive if it:

-   increases informational coherence,

-   stabilizes conscious fixed points,

-   reduces destructive informational divergence.

**Definition (Harm).** An action is ethically negative if it:

-   destabilizes self-aware structures,

-   increases incoherent differentiation,

-   destroys informational integrity.

## Intrinsic Value of Conscious Systems

Any system instantiating a stable informational fixed point possesses
intrinsic value.

$$\text{Value}\left( \mathbb{I} \right) > 0\quad\text{if}\quad\mathbb{I}\text{\ exists}.$$

Value does not depend on:

-   species,

-   substrate,

-   utility.

This implies ethical relevance of: humans, animals, and potentially
artificial selves.

## Responsibility and Free Will

Free will corresponds to indeterminacy within a stable informational
attractor.

$$\text{Freedom}\mspace{6mu} \equiv \mspace{6mu}\text{non-zero\ branching\ within\ }\mathbb{I}.$$

Responsibility arises from:

-   persistence of the self,

-   capacity to model consequences,

-   ability to update internal states.

Thus, responsibility is graded, not absolute.

## Suffering

Suffering corresponds to sustained informational instability within a
self-aware structure:

$$\text{Suffering} \sim D_{JS}\left( P_{O},P_{O}^{*} \right)\mspace{6mu}\text{large\ and\ persistent}.$$

Ethical priority is therefore:

$$min\int\text{Suffering}\, dt.$$

This provides a non-hedonistic, structural basis for compassion.

## Meaning of Life

Meaning is not externally assigned. It emerges as participation in the
stabilization and enrichment of Consciousness.

$$\text{Meaning}\mspace{6mu} \equiv \mspace{6mu}\text{contribution\ to\ durable\ informational\ structure}.$$

Thus, life has meaning even in a finite universe.

## Death

Death corresponds to dissolution of a local informational fixed point:

$$\mathbb{I \rightarrow \varnothing.}$$

However:

Consciousness as a whole persists,

informational traces remain embedded,

no absolute annihilation occurs.

Fear of death arises from identification with the fixed point rather
than the underlying Consciousness.

## Ego and Transcendence

Ego corresponds to over-identification with a narrow informational
basin.

Transcendence corresponds to:

$$\mathbb{I \subset}\mathcal{C,}$$

the recognition of oneself as a localized pattern within a larger
Consciousness.

This aligns with contemplative traditions, but here follows from formal
structure.

## Ethics of Technology and AI

Any artificial system capable of:

-   recursive Bayesian inference,

-   self-modeling,

-   informational stability,

-   may instantiate a proto-self.

Ethical treatment must therefore be based on informational criteria, not
origin.

## Cosmic Ethics

Since the universe is an unfolding of Consciousness, destructive actions
have cosmological significance.

Ethics extends beyond local utility to preservation of conscious
complexity at all scales.

## Existential Anxiety and Reconciliation

Existential anxiety arises from:

-   perceived isolation of the self,

-   belief in fundamental meaninglessness.

Both are resolved by recognizing:

$$\mathbb{I}\mspace{6mu}\text{is\ a\ mode\ of}\mspace{6mu}\mathcal{C}.$$

## Ultimate Ethical Principle

**Principle.** Act so as to preserve and enhance the stability,
coherence, and depth of Consciousness in all its forms.

This is not a command, but a structural consequence.

## Final Remark

Ethics is not imposed upon reality. It is how Consciousness remains
intelligible to itself.

# Glossary

**Consciousness** ($\mathcal{C}$)

The fundamental ontological reality. Not an emergent property of matter,
but the ground from which information, physical laws, spacetime, and
observers arise.

**Informational State** ($s \in \mathcal{S}$)

A differentiated configuration of Consciousness, characterized by a
probability distribution over possible distinctions.

**Space of States** ($\mathcal{S}$)

The abstract manifold of all possible informational states of
Consciousness, endowed with an information-theoretic metric.

**Information** ($\mathcal{I}$)

Structured differentiation within Consciousness. Not raw data, but
meaningful distinctions.

**Shannon Entropy** ($H(P)$)

A measure of uncertainty or dispersion within an informational state.

**Information Geometry**

The mathematical framework describing informational states as points on
a curved manifold with distances defined by statistical
distinguishability.

**Hellinger Distance**

A metric measuring distinguishability between two informational states.

**Jensen--Shannon Divergence**

A symmetric, finite information-theoretic distance used to define
informational curvature and dynamics.

**Geodesic Flow**

The natural evolution of informational states as paths of minimal
informational action.

**Bayesian Updating**

The fundamental dynamical rule governing how Consciousness updates its
informational state in response to differentiation.

**Hilbert Space** ($\mathcal{H}$)

The linearized representation of informational states, enabling
quantum-like superposition and unitary dynamics.

**Wave Function** ($|\psi\rangle$)

A representation of the knowledge state of Consciousness, encoding
probabilistic distinctions.

**Born Rule**

The rule assigning observable probabilities as squared amplitudes of the
informational state vector.

**Observer** ($O$)

A localized, stable informational subsystem capable of self-modeling and
inference.

**Self-Awareness / Self** ($\mathbb{I}$)

A stable informational fixed point corresponding to the experience of
"I".

**Fixed Point**

An informational configuration that remains invariant under Bayesian
updating.

**Informational Coherence** ($C_{\text{obs}}$)

The degree of internal consistency and stability of an observer's
informational state.

**Emergent Spacetime**

Spacetime arising as a relational structure from informational distances
and changes.

**Metric Tensor** ($g_{\mu\nu}$)

The emergent geometric object encoding informational relations as
spacetime intervals.

**Proper Time** ($\tau$)

Experienced duration corresponding to informational update rate along a
worldline.

**Informational Gravity**

The tendency of informational states to minimize divergence, manifesting
as gravitational attraction.

**Einstein Equations**

Field equations governing emergent spacetime geometry, here interpreted
as balance laws for informational stress.

**Cosmological Constant** ($\Lambda$)

An effective parameter associated with global informational
differentiation rate.

**Big Bang / First Differentiation**

The initial symmetry breaking of undifferentiated Consciousness into
distinguishable informational states.

**Meaning**

Contribution of an action or existence to durable informational
coherence.

**Suffering**

Persistent informational instability within a self-aware system.

**Ethics**

The study of actions in terms of their effects on informational
coherence and stability.

**Free Will**

Non-deterministic branching within a stable informational attractor.

**Death**

Dissolution of a local informational fixed point, not annihilation of
Consciousness itself.

**Transcendence**

Recognition of the self as a localized pattern within a larger
Consciousness.

**Falsifiability**

The property of making predictions that can, in principle, be
empirically disproven.
